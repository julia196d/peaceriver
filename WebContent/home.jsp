<h3>Manage your horses, farm and clients with our easy-to-use software</h3>
<p>
 If you're going to manage your horses properly, you need to keep a lot of records. Records on shoeing, teasing, breeding, worming, health, lameness, training and all the rest. Record keeping around our farm usually meant jotting a few notes on a calendar. We tried a few computerized horse record-keeping systems but all were slow, clunky and poorly organized.<br>
<br>We knew what we wanted in a computerized record-keeping system. We assembled the best team of computer nerds we could find to program it for us - guys that didn't know a horse from a mule but could probably hack their way into the Kremlin's computers if we asked them to. We call our
software record-keeping system <i><b>Peace River Pro - Horse Management Software</b></i>. We use <i><b>Peace River Pro - Horse Management Software</b></i> with our own horses and it is exactly what we were looking for and probably what you are looking for, too.<br>
<br><i><b>Peace River Pro - Horse Management Software</b></i> is a simple-to-use, yet powerful piece of
software which tracks vital information about your horses. It allows you to record what was done to the horse (wormed, shod, vaccinated, etc.), who performed the procedure, what the results were and how much it cost. You can cross-reference all this information by horse, owner or stable. You can easily access this information when you need it at a later date or use the powerful reporting feature to print out the information in a way that makes sense. You can print a report for a single horse, a single owner or an entire stable.&nbsp; 
	There's no limit to the number of horses you can enter into <b><i>Peace River Pro 
	- Horse Management Software</i></b>.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Peace River Pro - Horse Management Software</b></i> tracks:<br>
Hoofcare, Worming, Lameness, General Health, Feeding, Shoeing, Emergency Data, Inoculations, Medications, Training/Conditioning, 	Breeding &amp; Teasing,
Stallion Bookings &amp; Fertility, Addresses &amp; Phone Numbers, plus much more.&nbsp; Click here for an extensive list of 
<a href="eqftrs.html">features</a>. &nbsp;</p>
